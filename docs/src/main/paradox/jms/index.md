@@@ note { title="Java Message Service (JMS)" }

The Java Message Service (JMS) API is a Java message-oriented middleware API for sending messages between two or more clients. It is an implementation to handle the producerâ€“consumer problem. JMS is a part of the [Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE)](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/jms-concepts001.htm#BNCDR), and was defined by a specification developed at Sun Microsystems, but which has since been guided by the Java Community Process. It is a messaging standard that allows application components based on Java EE to create, send, receive, and read messages. It allows the communication between different components of a distributed application to be loosely coupled, reliable, and asynchronous.

The Apache Pekko Connectors JMS connector provides Apache Pekko Stream sources and sinks to connect to JMS providers.

In v1.1.0, there is also a Jakarta MS connector that provides the equivalent support for [Jakarta Messaging](https://jakarta.ee/learn/docs/jakartaee-tutorial/current/messaging/jms-concepts/jms-concepts.html).
