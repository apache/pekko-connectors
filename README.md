Systems don't come alone. In the modern world of microservices and cloud deployment, new components must interact with legacy systems, making integration an important key to success. Reactive Streams give us a technology-independent tool to let these heterogeneous systems communicate without overwhelming each other.

The Apache Pekko Connectors project is an open source initiative to implement stream-aware, reactive, integration pipelines for Java and Scala. It is built on top of Pekko Streams, and has been designed from the ground up to understand streaming natively and provide a DSL for reactive and stream-oriented programming, with built-in support for backpressure. Pekko Streams is a [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/) and JDK 9+ [java.util.concurrent.Flow](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Flow.html)-compliant implementation and therefore [fully interoperable](https://pekko.apache.org/docs/pekko/current/general/stream/stream-design.html#interoperation-with-other-reactive-streams-implementations) with other implementations.

Pekko Connectors is a fork of [Alpakka](https://github.com/akka/alpakka) 4.0.0, prior to the Akka project's adoption of the Business Source License.

## Documentation

Apache Pekko Connectors are documented at https://pekko.apache.org/docs/pekko-connectors/current/.

To keep up with the latest releases check out [Pekko Connectors releases](https://pekko.apache.org/docs/pekko-connectors/current/release-notes/index.html) and [Pekko Connectors Kafka releases](https://pekko.apache.org/docs/pekko-connectors-kafka/current/release-notes/index.html).

## Building From Source

The build commands in the [pekko](https://github.com/apache/pekko?tab=readme-ov-file#building-from-source) repo are also useful here. Java 17 should work well for building from source with the main branch. Pekko 1.x is best built with Java 8. If you build with newer versions of Java, ou will need to specify a number of `--add-opens` settings.

This repo contains shell scripts. These scripts are designed to help with the testing of Apache Pekko Connectors. Please avoid running the scripts without checking if you need to and try to understand what the script does first.

There are some binary files in this repo that are used in testing. These files do not contain compiled artifacts.

## Caveat Emptor

Pekko Connectors components are not always binary compatible between releases. API changes that are not backward compatible might be introduced as we refine and simplify based on your feedback. A module may be dropped in any release without prior deprecation. 

Our goal is to improve the stability and test coverage for Pekko Connectors APIs over time.
